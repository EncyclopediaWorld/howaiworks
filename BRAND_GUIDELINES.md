# Brand Guidelines (Name, Logo, Visual Identity)

The project name, logo, and associated branding are **not** granted under the open-source/content licenses unless explicitly stated.

These guidelines exist to (1) prevent user confusion, and (2) protect the integrity and reputation of the official project.

## Allowed

- Forking and modifying the **code** and **content** under their respective licenses.
- Honest attribution such as “Based on the original project by <Author> (link to the original repository).”
- Referring to the project name in text (e.g., in documentation) when it is clear you are **not** the official project.

## Required for public forks

If you publish a public fork (website, repo, package, SaaS, app store listing, etc.) you must:

1) **Rename** the project to avoid confusion with the official project, and  
2) **Remove or replace** the official logo/visual identity, and  
3) **Add a clear disclaimer** such as:  
   “This is an independent fork. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original author or Florida State University.”

## Not Allowed (without written permission)

- Using the project name or logo in a way that implies official status or endorsement.
- Marketing a fork as the official version.
- Using “official”, “certified”, “approved”, or similar language implying endorsement.
- Reusing the logo or visual identity as-is for a public fork.

## Recommended attribution

“Based on the original project by the original author (link to the original repository).”

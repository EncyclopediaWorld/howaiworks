# Commercial Use & Partnerships

This repository is designed for broad educational impact, while enabling sustainable long‑term commercialization.

## When you need a commercial license

If you want to use **the educational content** (text/narrative/explanations/demos as educational materials) for any commercial purpose, you need a separate written license from the author. Examples include (but are not limited to):

- Hosted/SaaS deployments sold to customers
- Paid courses, training, workshops, or certification content
- Enterprise/institutional deployments bundled into a paid offering
- Commercial consulting packages that redistribute the content

## Code vs content

- **Code** is Apache‑2.0 (commercial-friendly).
- **Content** is CC BY‑NC 4.0 by default (non‑commercial).
